## Navigating the Modes
- `Esc` -> Normal Mode, for moving, deleting, copying and pasting (this is the default mode)
- `i, a, o, etc.` -> Insert Mode, for typing/inserting text.
- `v, V,, or Ctrl + v` -> Visual Mode, selecting a block of text.

### Normal Mode: Movement (The Vim Language)
Movement commands are the most freq command we'll use. We can think them as verbs that can combined with other actions such as delete, change or copy.
|Command|Action|Description|
|---|---|---|
|`h, j, k, l`|Move|Left, Down, Up, Right (Home Row)|
